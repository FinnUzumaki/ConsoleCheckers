# ConsoleCheckers
A project from the first year of college.
Just wanted to save it somewhere.
It's in portuguese.
It's just a little project to make a console application that shows the fibonacci sequence, a hangman game and a checkers game for 2 players.
There are a many features of actual checkers that i didn't know how to implement, i did a work around so it's playable.
Didn't work very hard in the other two.
